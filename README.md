# The Steve Saga Mod for Minecraft Forge 1.12.2

## What is this mod?
The [Steve Saga](<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5jr0ZJTfioi2Zag3FT6QFhECcceBnNEE>) is an old YouTube Minecraft Roleplay series where the main character is in a world with supernatural entities, aka. the Steves.

I used to watch that series a lot when I was just a kid, and was really involved with it, going as far as creating videos and stories of my own.

This series basically had some items that were created using texture packs for better lore and overall storytelling, like Rainbow Stone for example.

My idea here was to create those blocks and items as blocks and items of their own instead of having to use a texture pack, and have some additional items that people can use for their own Steve Saga stories.

## Why have I made this mod?

One day, I was bored and wanted to get myself busy with something I'd like to work on.

The first idea that came to mind and was relatively simple was to build a Minecraft mod, and on one of the better versions that I, personally, have enjoyed playing the most, 1.12.2.

## Mod installation guide
1. To install this mod, you'll first wanna obtain the mod's JAR file, which is located in [/!MOD RELEASES/](<https://github.com/ItsWazzaP/steve-saga-mod/tree/main/!MOD%20RELEASES>).
2. To download the JAR file, click on the JAR's newest version, and in the top right corner should be a download button. Click it.
3. Go to `C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`, or wherever you installed Minecraft or changed the specific Minecraft version's installation directory.
4. Put the JAR file in there
5. Boot up Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 and enjoy

The mod has no other mod dependencies and works fine with OptiFine.
